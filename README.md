# AGPanel
Simple KSP plugin project I have used to learn how to create KSP plugins. I got sick of trying to remember what each Action Group did, and what number Action Group did what, so I created this.

In the VAB/SPH when you open the Action Groups, you will get a new panel where you can create custom labels for each Action Group. The custom labels will appear on buttons in a new panel that will be available in the Flight scene. The Vis toggle determines if this Custom Label will be visible in the Flight scene panel.

You can also choose what type of button will be used: A normal button, a toggle button or a single use button which will be removed after use (designed for fairing deployments, etc where after one use there is no more need for the button).

The editor is also available in Flight so you can continue to make changes.

## Presets
You also have the ability so save a setup in a preset which can be loaded again later so if for example you want to make Solar Deployment usually be Action Group 1 you can save this as a preset and load the preset for each new vessel.

## TODO
Still want to improve on the GUI.

Would like to offer additional colours for buttons (Beyond the Abort Group being red)

Need to make it possible to delete presets (Currently can only be done by editing the text file)
